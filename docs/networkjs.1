.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBNetworkJS\fR is a JavaScript Network Library, heavily inspired by the popular python equivalent NetworkX\.
.
.P
\fBnetworkjs\fR is a command line tool and it can also be used as a library through npm\. For the moment it supports three centrality measures on Graph networks, while the end goal is to have complete coverage over NetworkX api\'s\. It takes an input <file\.csv> which should be a comma separated csv file, and performs the calculations based on options\.
.
.P
The \fB\-\-degree\fR,\fB\-\-betweenness\fR and \fB\-\-eigenvector\fR options calculates those measures on the provided dataset\. The \fB\-\-help\fR flag displays command line options
.
.SH "FILE"
The \fBnetworkjs\fR command expects one valid csv file, which should be comma separated, for example \fBfile\.csv\fR\. This file should contain the edge list of a graph in the format of Source,Target,Weight,\.\.etc\. The header names should be specified after file name in the order of Source,Target and Weight (optional)
.
.SH "SOURCE,TARGET and WEIGHT"
\fBnetworkjs\fR expects the header names of source node, target node and weight node(optional) to be specified in order in order to perform calculations\. Source and Target are required in order to run the program
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
These options instruct \fBnetworkjs\fR to run the centrality measures on the provided dataset :
.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR,\fB\-\-degree\fR
Run Degree centrality measure over the given dataset, which is defined as the number of links incident upon a node\. \fIhttps://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Centrality#Degree_centrality\fR
.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR,\fB\-\-betweenness\fR
Run Betweenness centrality measure over the given dataset, which for a node is defined as the number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes\. \fIhttps://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Centrality#Betweenness_centrality\fR
.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR,\fB\-\-eigenvector\fR
Run Eigenvector centrality measure over the given dataset, which calculates the influence of a node in the network\. It assigns relative scores to all nodes in the network based on the concept that connections to high\-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node in question than equal connections to low\-scoring nodes\. \fIhttps://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Centrality#Eigenvector_centrality\fR
.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR,\fB\-\-help\fR
Display command line help usage for the methods available
.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
Provide the dataset csv and run the analysis on them like this :
.
.P
$ networkjs \-d \-e \-b file\.csv Source Target Weight
.

.
.SH "BUGS"
\fBNetworkJS\fR is written in NodeJS and hence requires NodeJS >= 0\.4\.3 to be installed in the system\. For any bugs do file an issue to the public repository \fIhttps://github\.com/koustuvsinha/networkjs/issues\fR
