.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBNetworkJS\fR is a JavaScript Network Library, heavily inspired by the popular python equivalent NetworkX\.
.
.P
\fBnetworkjs\fR is a command line tool and it can also be used as a library through npm\. For the moment it supports three centrality measures on Graph networks, while the end goal is to have complete coverage over NetworkX api\'s\. It takes an input <file\.csv> which should be a comma separated csv file, and performs the calculations based on options\.
.
.P
The \fB\-\-degree\fR,\fB\-\-betweenness\fR and \fB\-\-eigenvector\fR options calculates those measures on the provided dataset\. The \fB\-\-help\fR flag displays command line options
.
.SH "FILE"
The \fBnetworkjs\fR command expects one valid csv file, which should be comma separated, for example \fBfile\.csv\fR\. This file should contain the edge list of a graph in the format of Source,Target,Weight,\.\.etc\. The header names can be later provided within the system when prompted\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
These options instruct \fBnetworkjs\fR to run the centrality measures on the provided dataset :
.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR,\fB\-\-degree\fR
Run Degree centrality measure over the given dataset, which is defined as the number of links incident upon a node\. \fIhttps://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Centrality#Degree_centrality\fR
.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR,\fB\-\-betweenness\fR
Run Betweenness centrality measure over the given dataset, which for a node is defined as the number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes\. \fIhttps://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Centrality#Betweenness_centrality\fR
.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR,\fB\-\-eigenvector\fR
Run Eigenvector centrality measure over the given dataset, which calculates the influence of a node in the network\. It assigns relative scores to all nodes in the network based on the concept that connections to high\-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node in question than equal connections to low\-scoring nodes\. \fIhttps://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Centrality#Eigenvector_centrality\fR
.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR,\fB\-\-help\fR
Display command line help usage for the methods available
.
.SH "PROMPTS"
While running the command, \fBnetworkjs\fR will prompt for the following inputs:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBsourceNode\fR : Provide the column name for the node to be the source of an edge
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBtargetNode\fR : Provide the column name for the node to be the target of an edge
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBweightNode\fR : Provide the column name for the weight attribute (Optional, if not provided graph will be treated as unweighted)
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
Provide the dataset csv and run the analysis on them like this :
.
.P
$ networkjs \-d \-e \-b file\.csv
.
.P

$ man networkjs
.
.SH "BUGS"
\fBNetworkJS\fR is written in NodeJS and hence requires NodeJS >= 0\.4\.3 to be installed in the system\. For any bugs do file an issue to the public repository \fIhttps://github\.com/koustuvsinha/networkjs/issues\fR
